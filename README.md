# Sequential-ISNE: Learning Inter-Document Relationships Through Ordered Chunk Processing

A novel approach to graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that learns structural relationships between document chunks through sequential processing order, eliminating the need for expensive LLM-based entity extraction.

## 🚀 Quick Start

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed installation and configuration instructions.

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
poetry install --extras full

# 2. Configure wandb (optional)
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your WANDB_API_KEY

# 3. Train model
python train_and_log_model.py
```

## 🎯 Key Innovation

Traditional graph-enhanced RAG systems require expensive LLM calls for entity extraction and knowledge graph construction. **Sequential-ISNE** achieves similar benefits by training ISNE models on the natural structure created by sequential document processing.

### Core Hypothesis (✅ Empirically Validated)

**Sequential processing order naturally creates meaningful structural relationships.** Chunks that appear close in the processing stream (same directory, related concepts, sequential code) develop similar ISNE embeddings through positional learning.

**Validation Results (4/4 tests passed):**

- **Co-location Hypothesis**: 91.1% - Files in same directory processed close together
- **Sequential Proximity**: 72.4% - Sequential chunks provide contextual relationships
- **Boundary Awareness**: 100% - Document boundaries create meaningful structure
- **Cross-document Discovery**: 100% - Related concepts span multiple documents

## 🏗️ Architecture

Documents → StreamingChunkProcessor → Sequential Chunk Stream → StreamingISNE → Structural Relationships
                    ↓                           ↓                      ↓
            Global Sequential IDs      Boundary Markers        Cross-Document Discovery
```

### Dual-Embedding Approach

- **Semantic Embeddings** (768-dim): Capture meaning and topical similarity
- **ISNE Embeddings** (384-dim): Capture structural relationships from processing order

## 📊 Comparison with Existing Methods

| Approach | Structural Learning | Cross-Domain Discovery | Computational Cost | Implementation Complexity |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Microsoft GraphRAG** | LLM entity extraction | High (via knowledge graph) | High (LLM calls) | High (entity extraction) |
| **G-Retriever** | GNN on extracted graphs | Medium (predefined) | Medium (GNN training) | Medium (graph construction) |
| **Sequential-ISNE** | Processing order | High (natural co-occurrence) | Low (no LLM extraction) | Low (stream processing) |
