# Sequential-ISNE: Directory-Informed Graph Neural Network Embeddings

A directory-informed implementation of ISNE (Inductive Shallow Node Embedding) that bootstraps graph structure from filesystem organization.

**Based on the original ISNE method with directory-informed graph bootstrap for proper ISNE application.**

## Overview

Sequential-ISNE discovers theory-practice bridges between research papers and code implementations by using directory structure as an implicit knowledge graph. This approach solves the fundamental challenge of applying ISNE (a graph embedding algorithm) by bootstrapping proper graph structure from filesystem organization, creating semantically meaningful relationships between co-located files, import dependencies, and cross-modal content.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run focused demo
python3 simple_demo.py /path/to/dataset

# Run comprehensive academic validation
python3 academic_test.py

# Full pipeline (for well-prepared datasets)
python3 demo.py /path/to/dataset --config config.yaml
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: For optimal results, datasets must be properly prepared with documentation cross-references. See [Dataset Preparation Guide](./DATASET_PREPARATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

## Key Features

### Directory-Informed Graph Bootstrap
- **DirectoryGraph Class**: Builds initial graph from filesystem structure
- **Co-location Edges**: Files in same directory have strong relationships (weight 1.0)
- **Import Edges**: Python import statements create directed edges (weight 0.9)  
- **Semantic Edges**: Cross-modal embeddings create theory-practice bridges (threshold 0.7)

### Proper ISNE Implementation
- **Graph-Based Training**: ISNE operates on actual graph neighborhoods (not sequential chunks)
- **Chunk-to-Node Mapping**: Resolves the fundamental chunk-to-node mapping problem
- **Cross-Modal Learning**: Discovers relationships between documentation and code

### Complete Pipeline
- **Data Normalization** with Docling (PDFs ‚Üí markdown)
- **Unified Chunking** with Chonky (text) and AST (Python)  
- **CodeBERT Embeddings** for both text and code modalities
- **Directory-Informed Bridge Detection** using graph structure

## Architecture Recovery

This implementation recovers from a fundamental conceptual error where ISNE (a graph embedding algorithm) was incorrectly applied to sequential chunks without proper graph structure. The solution uses directory structure as an implicit knowledge graph:

```

```

## Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` or use Poetry with `pyproject.toml`

## Core Components

### DirectoryGraph (`directory_graph.py`)
Bootstrap graph construction from filesystem structure:
```python
from directory_graph import DirectoryGraph

# Create graph from directory structure
graph = DirectoryGraph()
graph.bootstrap_from_directory(root_path, file_contents)
graph.extend_with_semantic_similarity(embeddings, threshold=0.7)

# Find theory-practice bridges
bridges = graph.find_theory_practice_bridges()
```

### Enhanced Sequential-ISNE (`src/sequential_isne.py`)
Proper ISNE training with directory-informed graphs:
```python
from src.sequential_isne import SequentialISNE

# Train with directory structure
model = SequentialISNE(config)
model.build_graph_from_directory_graph(directory_graph, chunks)
results = model.train_embeddings()
```

## Key Innovation

**Directory Structure as Implicit Knowledge Graph**: The breakthrough insight is using filesystem organization to bootstrap the graph structure that ISNE requires. This solves the chicken-and-egg problem of needing a graph to apply a graph embedding algorithm.

## üìã Dataset Preparation Requirements

### Critical: Documentation Cross-Reference Structure

For optimal ISNE bootstrap, datasets **must** include:

#### 1. **Directory-Level Documentation**
Every directory requires custom documentation:
```
dataset/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                    # Top-level overview with cross-references
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ subdirectory-a/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # Directory-specific documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ subdirectory-b/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # Directory-specific documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ theory-papers/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # Theory overview
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ category-1/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Category-specific documentation
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ category-2/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Category-specific documentation
```

#### 2. **Explicit Cross-References**
Documentation files must link to each other (creating "documentation imports"):

**Top-level README.md:**
```markdown
## Documentation Structure
- [Implementation A](./subdirectory-a/README.md) - Core algorithms
- [Implementation B](./subdirectory-b/README.md) - Supporting utilities  
- [Theory Papers](./theory-papers/README.md) - Theoretical foundations

## Cross-Domain Connections
- Implementation A ‚Üî [Theory Category 1](./theory-papers/category-1/README.md)
- Implementation B ‚Üî [Theory Category 2](./theory-papers/category-2/README.md)
```

**Subdirectory README.md:**
```markdown
# Implementation A

## Theoretical Foundation
Based on concepts from [Theory Category 1](../theory-papers/category-1/README.md).

## Related Implementations
- [Implementation B](../subdirectory-b/README.md) - Complementary approach
- [Top-level Overview](../README.md) - Complete system context
```

#### 3. **Theory-Practice Bridge Documentation**
Explicit mapping between theoretical papers and code implementations:
```markdown
## Theory ‚Üí Code Mapping
- **Paper Section 2.1** ‚Üí [algorithm.py](./src/algorithm.py)
- **Theorem 3** ‚Üí [optimization.py](./src/optimization.py)
- **Figure 4** ‚Üí [visualization.py](./utils/visualization.py)
```

#### 4. **Why This Matters for ISNE Bootstrap**

Documentation cross-references create **explicit graph edges**:
- **Co-location edges**: Files in same directory (implicit)
- **Import edges**: Python import statements (explicit)  
- **Documentation edges**: Markdown cross-references (explicit)
- **Semantic edges**: ISNE-discovered relationships (learned)

Without proper documentation cross-references, ISNE can only rely on co-location and imports, missing crucial **conceptual relationships** between directories and abstraction levels.

### üîß **Dataset Validation Checklist**

Before running ISNE bootstrap:
- [ ] Every directory has custom README.md
- [ ] Top-level documentation links to all subdirectories  
- [ ] Subdirectory documentation references related directories
- [ ] Theory papers are explicitly linked to implementations
- [ ] Cross-domain relationships are documented
- [ ] Remove irrelevant boilerplate (SECURITY.md, etc.)

**Result**: Rich graph structure with multiple edge types enabling superior ISNE relationship discovery.
