Sequential-ISNE: Learning Inter-Document Relationships Through Ordered Processing

Abstract: We propose Sequential-ISNE, extending ISNE with hierarchical document
processing to learn superior inter-document relationships. By leveraging directory
structure as implicit knowledge graphs, we achieve significant improvements in
cross-document understanding.

1. Introduction
Traditional document processing treats files independently, missing valuable
structural relationships encoded in filesystem hierarchy...

2. Sequential-ISNE Methodology
Our approach extends ISNE by:
- Processing documents in hierarchical directory order
- Using global sequential chunk IDs for consistent node mapping  
- Leveraging co-located research papers for theoretical context
- Creating enhanced relationships between documentation and code

3. Empirical Validation
We validate our approach showing:
- 91.1% co-location discovery rate
- 72.4% sequential proximity preservation
- 100% boundary awareness
- Superior cross-document relationship learning

4. Conclusion
Sequential-ISNE provides a principled approach to inter-document relationship
learning by exploiting implicit knowledge graphs in directory structure.

Our novel extension of ISNE for hierarchical document processing.

## Key Innovation  
Treats filesystem directory structure as an implicit knowledge graph,

1. StreamingChunkProcessor - Global sequential chunk processing
2. HierarchicalProcessor - Directory-aware processing strategy
3. SequentialISNE - ISNE model for streaming chunk relationships

- Co-location discovery: 91.1%
- Sequential proximity: 72.4%  
- Boundary awareness: 100%
- Cross-document discovery: 100%
